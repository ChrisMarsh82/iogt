    IoGT uses Wagtail, Django, and a number of custom plugins to deploy
    a website that can scale from feature phones all the way to desktops. Throughout
    this documentation, this software solution will be referred to as
    "the IoGT Wagtail CMS", or more simply as "the CMS".

    Documents, and Media files currently loaded on the site, as well as your recently

- title: Page
  desc: |-
    In the IoGT Wagtail CMS, the Page is the simplest form of presenting content. There are
    different variations of the Page. Each has differnt use cases. See "Page Types" below for
    a list of different Page variations.

- title: Page Types
  desc: |-
    Pages can be any one of the following:

    * Article
    * Homepage
    * Poll
    * Quiz
    * Section
    * Survey
    * Banner

    For more information, see the appropriate definition for each Page Type below.

- title: Article
  desc: |-
    Articles are a Page Type used to present text, images, and other content to the user in an
    article-like format. Articles are created as a Child Page of a Section. Polls, Surveys, Quizzes,
    and Media files can be linked to from within an Article.

- title: Homepage
  desc: |-
    The IoGT Wagtail CMS will automatically create a home page for each published Section. However,
    the special Homepage Page Type can be used to create a custom set of Child Pages to display to
    the user. They can be used to create a small, curated list of a large Section.

- title: Poll
  desc: |-
    Polls are a Page Type used to quickly gather information from users. Polls should be used when
    there are fewer questions, and if these questions have simple answer types. Surveys should be used
    when the answers need to be more complex. For more information on the types of answers Polls can
    take, see "Answer Types" below.

- title: Quiz
  desc: |-
    As the name suggests, Quizzes are a Page Type used to test user knowledge about a topic, either before
    or after reading an Article about it. Quizzes have a much broader range of answer types than Polls do.
    See "Answer Types" below for more information.

- title: Section
  desc: |-
    Sections are a special kind of Page, as they can contain other Pages within them, including other Sections.
    Sections that are Child Pages of other Sections are called Subsections. Sections (and Subsections) can be
    infinitely nested. Sections (and Subsections) have an auto-generated home page; additional custom Homepages
    can be created using the Homepage Page Type.

- title: Survey
  desc: |-
    Whereas Polls are used to quickly gather information and opinions from users, Surveys are used to gather more
    detailed information. As such, they have a much broader range of answer types, similar to Quizzes. See "Answer Types"
    below for more information.

- title: Banner Page
  desc: |-
    Banner Pages are special types of Pages which are images that appear at the top of Sections and link to another Page.
    They can link to Sections, Articles, Surveys, etc. Banner Pages can only be created inside Banner Index Pages. See
    "Index Page" below for more information.

- title: Answer Types
  desc: |-
    The answers for Polls, Quizzes, and Surveys all draw from the same set of Answer Types, however Polls can only
    use a small subset of these Answer Types. A list of all Answer Types, along with a brief description, are presented
    here. Answer Types presented in _italics_ are the only types Polls can use. Remember, Quizzes and Surveys can use **all**
    of the below Answer Types. Examples are presented in (parentheses)

    * Single-line text - short free-form responses
    * Multi-line text - long free-form responses
    * Email - email values (john.doe@example.com)
    * Number - numerical values (42)
    * URL - URL values (subdomain.domain.tld)
    * _Checkbox_ - Select/unselect a single checkbox
    * _Checkboxes_ - Select/unselect multiple checkboxes
    * Dropdown - Select one value from a list of values
    * _Multiple Select_ - Select multiple values from a list of values
    * _Radio Buttons_ - Select a single value from a list of values; cannot unselect
    * Date - Enter a date (yyyy-mm-dd -> 2020-03-11)
    * Datetime - Enter a datetime (yyyy-mm-dd HH:mm:ss -> 2020-03-11 18:02:30)
    * Hidden Field - Disables the question entirely; can be used for hiding questions in a live Quiz/Survey

    Index Pages are special types of Pages that can only exist at the root of a site language. Index Pages
    can only contain one type of Child Page. For example, Section Index Pages can only contain Sections.
    Banner Index pages can only contain Banners. Sites are typically organized as `site language` -> `index page` -> `Pages`
