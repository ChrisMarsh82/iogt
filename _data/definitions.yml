      IoGT uses Wagtail, Django, and a number of custom code to deploy
      a website that can scale from feature phones all the way to desktops. Throughout
      this documentation, this software solution will be referred to as
      "the IoGT Wagtail CMS", or more simply as "the CMS".

- title: Page
  desc: |-
      In the IoGT Wagtail CMS, the Page is the simplest form of presenting content. There are
      different variations of the Page. Each has different use cases. See "Page Types" below for
      a list of different Page variations.

- title: Page Types
  desc: |-
      Pages can be any one of the following:

      * Article
      * Homepage
      * Poll
      * Quiz
      * Section
      * Survey
      * Banner

      For more information, see the appropriate definition for each Page Type below.

- title: Article
  desc: |-
      Articles are a Page Type used to present text, images, and other content to the user in an
      article-like format. Articles are created as a Child Page of a Section. Polls, Surveys, Quizzes,
      and Media files can be linked to from within an Article.

- title: Homepage
  desc: |-
      The Homepage Page Type can be used to create a custom set of Child Pages to display to
      the user. They can be used to create a small, curated list of a content. For example,
      when navigating to `xx.goodinternet.org/home`, you are accessing a Homepage. When you translate
      the site into multiple languages, you will create different Homepages for each language.

- title: Poll
  desc: |-
      Polls are a Page Type used to quickly gather information from users. Polls can only contain one
      question and that question can only take simple answer choices. Surveys should be used
      when there are multiple questions, or if answers need to be more complex.
      For more information on the types of answers Polls can take, see "Answer Types" below.

- title: Quiz
  desc: |-
      As the name suggests, Quizzes are a Page Type used to test user knowledge about a topic, such as before
      or after reading an Article about it. Quizzes have a much broader range of answer types than Polls do.
      Each question within a Quiz has a correct answer. See "Answer Types" below for more information.

- title: Section
  desc: |-
      Sections are a special kind of Page, as they can contain other Pages within them, including other Sections.
      Sections that are Child Pages of other Sections are called Subsections. There is no limit to the number of levels
      of Sections and Subsections. The page for the Section will list the content and Banners within the Section
      and can be customized.

- title: Survey
  desc: |-
      Whereas Polls are used to quickly gather information and opinions from users, Surveys are used to gather more information.
      As such, they have a much broader range of answer types, similar to Quizzes. See "Answer Types" below for more information.

- title: Banner Page
  desc: |-
      Banner Pages are special types of Pages which are images that appear at the top of Sections and link to another Page.
      They can link to Sections, Articles, Surveys, etc. Banner Pages can only be created inside Banner Index Pages. See
      "Index Page" below for more information.

- title: Answer Types
  desc: |-
      The answers for Polls, Quizzes, and Surveys all draw from the same set of Answer Types, however Polls can only
      use a small subset of these Answer Types. A list of all Answer Types, along with a brief description, are presented
      here. Answer Types presented in **bold** are the only types Polls can use. Remember, Quizzes and Surveys can use **all**
      of the below Answer Types. Examples are presented in (parentheses)

      * Single-line text - short free-form responses
      * Multi-line text - long free-form responses
      * Email - email values (john.doe@example.com)
      * Number - numerical values (42)
      * URL - URL values (subdomain.domain.tld)
      * **Checkbox** - Select/unselect a single checkbox
      * **Checkboxes** - Select/unselect multiple checkboxes
      * Dropdown - Select one value from a list of values
      * **Multiple Select** - Select multiple values from a list of values
      * **Radio Buttons** - Select a single value from a list of values; once the user has selected a response, they can change their response but cannot unselect
      * Date - Enter a date in the Gregorian calendar (yyyy-mm-dd -> 2020-03-11)
      * Datetime - Enter a datetime in the Gregorian calendar (yyyy-mm-dd HH:mm:ss -> 2020-03-11 18:02:30)
      * Hidden Field - Disables the question entirely; can be used for hiding questions in a live Quiz/Survey

- title: Index Page
  desc: |-
      Index Pages are special types of Pages that can only exist as the direct child of a Homepage.
      Index Pages are similar to folders on your operating system, but can only contain one type
      of Child Page. For example, all site Banners will go into a Banner Index Page. Similarly,
      all site Footers will go into a Footer Index Page. All Sections go into a Section Index Page.
      Those Sections can contain any Page, including Articles, Homepages, Polls, Surveys, Quizzes,
      and Subsections. Sites are typically organized as `Homepage` -> `Index Page` -> `Pages`
