If you want to view, moderate, and/or reply to comments made anywhere on the site, use the main menu and navigate to Comments > All Comments.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/img/docs/comments-view.png" alt="The comments view" caption="This is the Comments view. Here, you can see all comments made to all articles. You can take a variety of actions on this page." %}

To reply to comments, hover over the comment you wish to reply to and click "Reply." You will then be able to select a Canned Response (this will be covered in a later section) or enter free-form text as a response. You can also choose to sign the reply with a name. After replying, you can navigate using the main menu to Comments > All Comments to view your reply.
