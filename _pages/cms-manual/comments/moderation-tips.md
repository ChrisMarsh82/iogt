To moderate comments, first navigate to the Comments view by using the main menu and navigating to Comments > All Comments.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/img/docs/comments-view.png" alt="The comments view" caption="This is the Comments view. Here, you can see all comments made to all articles. You can take a variety of actions on this page." %}

There are a variety of options available here. To take action on an individual comment, hover over the comment and you will be presented with several buttons:

- Edit - Edit information and metadata about the comment
- Delete - Permanently remove the comment from the site. It will no longer be visible on either the front-end or on Wagtail
- Hide/Show - Appears to delete/undelete comments from the frontend. If hidden, other users will see "This comment has been deleted as it did not follow the site rules" or a similar message. It will still be visble on Wagtail
- Publish/Unpublish - Make the comment fully visible/unvisible. If unpublished, there will be no indication that the comment ever existed on the frontend. It will still be visble on Wagtail.
- Reply - Add a reply to the comment. See the section on replying for more information
- Clear Flags - remove all content flags from the comment _(Visible only if the comment was flagged)_

On the top bar, there are a couple options:

- Search - search comments by content
- Download - Download all comments and data as either an Excel spreadsheet (XSLX) or CSV file
- Add Comment - create a new comment

The right sidebar has a variety of options to sort and filter the comments by, including:
- Whether the comment is flagged
- Whether it has been removed
- Whether it is published
- When it was made
