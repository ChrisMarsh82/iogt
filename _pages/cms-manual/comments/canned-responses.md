A canned response is a set of replies uploaded to Wagtail, that you can quickly select to reply to an end user. A canned response can be useful if you want to reply quickly. E.g : "If you need assistance now, please call this number XX", including the number of a child helpline, or providing the emergency services hotline.

To manage canned responses, use the main menu to navigate to Comments > Canned Responses. Click "Add Canned Response" in the top right corner to add a new canned response. Simply fill out the text and press save at the bottom of the screen. You will now be able to use this canned response the next time you reply to a user's comment by using the dropdown on the Replying screen.
