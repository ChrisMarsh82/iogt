Users can report (flag) comments that they find offensive. These comments will still be visible to other users until a moderation action is taken on them, such as deleting or hiding the comment.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/img/docs/comments-view.png" alt="The comments view" caption="This is the Comments view. Here, you can see all comments made to all articles. You can take a variety of actions on this page." %}

You can use the filters on the right side of the Comments View to quickly sort out which comments have been flagged by users for possibly containing inappropriate or offensive content. You will be able to delete or hide the comments in that event that the comment contains inappropriate material. If the comment was falsely reported and does not contain offensive content, you can clear the flag on the comment by hovering over the comment name and pressing "Clear Flags".
