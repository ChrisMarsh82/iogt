To view the Survey Results, find the Survey in the Main Menu > Survey section of Wagtail. Hover over the survey name, then click `Edit`.

In the Survey Submissions section of the `Content` tab, click on the number of submissions. This will then show you a tabular view of all the surveys. You can filter by date of submission and export as either an Excel spreadsheet (.XSLX) or as a comma-serperated values file (.CSV).
