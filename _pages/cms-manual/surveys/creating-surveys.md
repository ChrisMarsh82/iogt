There are two ways to create a survey:

- Creating it from the main Surveys menu and then selecting the parent page
- Creating it "in-place" within the desired parent page

### Creating a survey from the main Surveys menu

To create a survey from the main menu, click `Surveys` from the Main Menu, then click `Add Survey` in the top right corner of the page.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/img/docs/homepage-surveys.png" alt="Surveys view" caption="Surveys view. Click 'Add Survey' to create a new survey." %}

Then select the parent page for the survey. Remember, different site languages will have different content; your surveys will not automatically translate or be copied into the other languages. Once you have selected the parent page, scroll to the bottom of the page and then click `Continue`.

See the following sections for help on add survey content.

### Creating a survey in-place

To create a survey in-place, navigate to the parent page you would like the survey to be in from the Pages menu. Then, select `Add Child Page`. Then select `Survey`. See the following sections for help on add survey content.
