Please note that when creating content pages, the order of these pages on the site Frontend will follow a chronological listing format. The first article you load will remain at the top of the page, with subsequent articles appearing below it. It's important to note that Molo will show your content items in the reverse order, with the latest article loaded appearing at the top of a list of articles. When loading content, be clear how you want content to appear to your site visitor and check the order on the Frontend URL. 

Wagtail allows you to reorder the appearance of sections, subsections or articles on the Front end. You can individually move them into a new listing position using the page reordering Handles. These appear as two small arrows facing opposite directions to the left of any list of Child pages. 

**Here's what you need to know about Handles:**

- First, enable the Handles by clicking on the "Sort" icon. It is the first column in the child page list.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/img/docs/reorder-pages.png" alt="Sort icon" caption="Click on the Sort icon to show the Handles" %}

- Once clicked, the Handles should now be visible as six dots (as on a die) to the left of the child page name.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/img/docs/pages-handles.png" alt="Handles" caption="The Handles will appear to the left of the child page name." %}

- Reorder the pages by dragging and dropping the Handles up or down into the desired position.
- The new order will be automatically saved each time you drag and drop an item.
