Content structure builds the navigation for the end user. Sections, subsections and articles are the terms best used to describe how your content can be structured. 

On Molo, the terms Parent and Child describe the navigational relationship between any higher page (or section) and lower page (or subsection). On Molo, a Child page becomes a Parent page when an additional navigation level is created below it and populated with additional Child pages. The article is the last in the lineage.

Adding main sections to your site is like creating content 'buckets' for your content. Inside a main section, you can put more 'buckets' (subsections) - and, inside of these, your articles. 

If you have a limited amount of content, you may only need to create sections for your articles without adding subsections. 

Typically a website has minimum three navigational levels, but it is  up to you how many you want:

_Section > Subsection > Article;_ or, 

_Parent > Parent (Child of a Parent) > Child._ 

And in the example below: _Sport > Soccer > Doe Injured._
