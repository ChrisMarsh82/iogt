Users can find the footer page at the bottom of the site. Generally, information like 'About us', 'Contact us' and site 'Terms of Use' is found here. There’s already a footer page on your site called “About the Internet of Good Things”. There’s also Terms and Conditions. However, this footer page is currently unpublished.

## How to create a footer page

- Select Pages --> (Site language) --> Footers. Then select `Add Child Page`.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/img/docs/footers-page.png" alt="Footers page view" caption="Footers page view. Select Add Child Page to create a new site footer." %}

- Fill out the title field and optionally add a lead image. This is an image that will be displayed in the footer. Then, using the buttons available, create the body of your footer. You can add the following items:
    - Heading
    - Paragraph
    - Markdown
    - Image
    - List
    - Numbered list
    - Page button
    - Embedded content:
        - Poll
        - Survey
        - Quiz
